## Aditya Pandey

**First-year CSE student at MIT Manipal**  
Aspiring research-oriented developer  
Alias: `K0RAG`


I am a problem solver driven by a strong imagination and a desire to build systems that **evolve**, not just execute.  
My focus lies in understanding fundamentals deeply and applying them to meaningful engineering problems.

This website serves as a **living record** of my learning, thinking, and experimentation.

## About / Mission

I aim to engineer solutions that simplify the lives of future engineers.  
Rather than chasing surface-level results, I value:

- First-principles thinking  
- Clean abstractions
- Problem solving 

I believe good engineering is not about writing more code, but about **writing the right code**.

## Current Focus

- Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning fundamentals  
- Research workflows and tooling  
- Linux and systems programming  

I actively document what I learn, what fails, and what improves my understanding.

## Technical Stack

**Languages**
- Python  
- Java  
- C++

**Tools & Platforms**
- Linux  
- Git & GitHub    
- HTML & CSS  

This stack will evolve as my interests deepen.
